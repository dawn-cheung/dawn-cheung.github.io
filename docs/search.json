    "text": "Welcome to the data story of the world’s digital inequality, and why it kinda sucks!\nThis very webpage is a testament to how far digital technologies have come. All of the data presented collated here, and the tools used for collation (Rstudio, Quarto, various library packages, etc) were accessed and/or downloaded from the internet with a clunky old laptop. Hence, you would think that once this data story is published online, virtually anyone could access it! However, this is clearly not the case. \nBelow is a widget that shows, across space, 3 key factors that affects one’s ability to use the internet:\n\nphysical access to the internet (i.e. the availability of the relevant infocomm technologies, like cell towers and electronic devices),\nthe price of internet, and\nspeed of internet (the widget uses download speed which is basically how fast you can receive information from the web). \n\nYou might be wondering: “Why go beyond access to the internet? As long as the resource is physically available, isn’t that enough?” Well, imagine I opened an uncooked meat store in every country and city in the world. Everyone can buy infinite meat; global hunger solved! But some people don’t have access to stoves or spaces to make fires to cook the meat, some people are allergic to/can’t eat meat, maybe at some locations I only sell meat scraps that are about to go bad, and perhaps the most obvious caveat: some people simply can’t afford the meat, even if its right there in my store. The same goes for the internet.\nThe access, price and speed of internet are equally important for digital equity. The graphs after this widget will further demonstrate the impact of all 3 factors, but if the widget below still hasn’t loaded yet, I think that’s a pretty solid case for why internet speed so important.\n\n\nOn a more serious note, if the widget still refuses to load, try switching off background processes (eg Youtube, Spotify, Canvas, Discord, etc), then reload the page. Otherwise, try this link instead https://myshinyappplease.shinyapps.io/MyShinyApp/. As a last resort, restart your computer, use someone elses computer with a higher RAM capacity, or download the application files from my github and run “app.R” on your local machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatter graph shows that internet usage directly contributes to economic development. There is a positive correlation between a country's access to the internet and economic output; as the percentage of the population accessing the internet increases, the logarithm of GDP per capita increases. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter graph plot \"How price of internet affects access to the internet\" shows that as the price of internet (PoI) increases, the percentage of the population accessing the internet decreases. The negative correlation between the cost of the internet and access to the internet shows that financial cost is a hindrance to accessing digital resources. \n\n\n\n\n\ninsert flavour text explaining whats gg on \n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that the World Wide Web originated from Europe? Despite the EU being the birthplace of the internet, there is still significant digital inequality within the EU. This graph shows that within the EU, lower economic development impedes the population’s digital skills. As GDP increases, the proportion of the country’s population with basic digital skills, above basic digital skills, and females possessing digital skills increases. This means that in countries like Bulgaria and Romania, even if you have an internet connection, you might not have the skills to use the digital tools and resources discerningly and/or appropriately, which means you’re more likely to fall for online scams and fake news.\n\nSo now the question is, how does the internet benefit people, or in other words,\n\nHow does the internet act as an enabler?\n\nThere are many good things that good internet can bring about. The 4 factors I’d like to bring up are: increased access to knowledge and information, enhancing education and educational institutions, strengthening democracy and increasing socio-emotional wellbeing.\n\nKNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDUCATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEMOCRACY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOCIO-EMOTIONAL WELLBEING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninsert flavour text explaining whats gg on \n(1) Hi!
