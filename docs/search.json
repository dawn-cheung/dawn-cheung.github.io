    "text": "Welcome to the data story of the world’s digital inequality, and why it kinda sucks!\nThis very webpage is a testament to how far digital technologies have come. All of the data presented collated here, and the tools used for collation (Rstudio, Quarto, various library packages, etc) were accessed and/or downloaded from the internet with a clunky old laptop. Hence, you would think that once this data story is published online, virtually anyone could access it! However, this is clearly not the case. \nBelow is a widget that shows, across space, 3 key factors that affects one’s ability to use the internet:\n\nphysical access to the internet (i.e. the availability of the relevant infocomm technologies, like cell towers and electronic devices),\nthe price of internet, and\nspeed of internet (the widget uses download speed which, simply put, is how fast you can receive information from the web).\n\nYou might be wondering: “Why go beyond access to the internet? As long as the resource is physically available, isn’t that enough?”\n\n\ninsert flavour text explaining whats gg on \n\n\n\n\n\ninsert flavour text explaining whats gg on \n\n\n\n\n\n\ninsert flavour text explaining whats gg on\n\n\n\n\n\ninsert flavour text explaining whats gg on \n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that the World Wide Web originated from Europe? Despite the EU being the birthplace of the internet, there is still significant digital inequality within the EU. This graph shows that within the EU, lower economic development impedes the population’s digital skills. As GDP increases, the proportion of the country’s population with basic digital skills, above basic digital skills, and females possessing digital skills increases. This means that in countries like Bulgaria and Romania, even if you have an internet connection, you might not have the skills to use the digital tools and resources discerningly and/or appropriately, which means you’re more likely to fall for online scams and fake news.\n\n\n\n\n\ninsert flavour text explaining whats gg on \n(1) Hi!
