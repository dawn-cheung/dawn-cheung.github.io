p.s. if you've been redirected from `<a href =`{=html}https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F0JPeF3S7A6dY621TJ5rCcIuw9SP7olN`>`{=html}this google drive link</a>, don't worry, you're in the right place! I've just been... *redecorating*. Or making it easier to scan through than a wall of files, at least.

You can find the exact same videos / graphics (and more!) in the "Work" and "Play" tabs. The "Work" tab contains more official projects done for school / work, while the "Play" tab is for projects that are less polished, and done more for my own enjoyment & exploration than anything else. <br><br>

p.p.s. SPECIAL thank you to this guy and his lecture slides: [https://damien-dupre.github.io/BAA1028/lectures/lecture_1](https://damien-dupre.github.io/BAA1028/lectures/lecture_1#/title-slide)

He doesn't know me. But now I know him. Parasocially. Just stumbled upon the slides; really like the guy. Anyways. This is the most approachable and understandable guide on how to make & customise Quarto websites I could find. I was so close to giving up and re-starting from scratch with a trad. HTML / CSS / JS file structure but now I don't have to!!! Yippie everyone clap now
